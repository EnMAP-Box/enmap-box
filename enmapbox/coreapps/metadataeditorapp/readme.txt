This folder contains an exemplary small EnMAP-Box Application

To implement your own EnMAP-Box Application:

1. Copy and rename it (reanming is required, since an app called "exampleapp" will be ignored during start of the EnMAP-Box
2. Check the examples in sandbox.py
3. Start the EnMAP-Box and check if your application  is loaded


If you wish to bring an existing application into the EnMAP-Box

1. Get it running in the QGIS Python environment and ensure reuqired packages are installed (yes, I'am talking about you who use conda enviromments).
2. Copy the EnMAP-Box Application example, change it as you like to connect to your application.
3. Test it in the EnMAP-Box, without having a QGIS Instance started.
4. Test it with an EnMAP-Box that was started from a QGIS Instance.
