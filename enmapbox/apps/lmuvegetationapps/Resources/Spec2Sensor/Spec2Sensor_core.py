***************************************************************************

This module handles the conversion between sensors, mostly in terms of spectral downsampling to the characteristics
of the "target sensor". It was originally designed to obtain pseudo-EnMAP spectra from ASD FieldSpec reflectances
-> 400-2500nm @ 1nm ==> 242 EnMAP bands; without altering the spatial resolution or performing any other radiometric
processing.

There are two classes: one performs the conversion when the spectral response function (SRF) is already there in
the form of numpy files with .srf extension. These .srf-files can only be read by THIS module, they are not
standardized in any form! They are just binary files containing the weights associated with wavelengths for all
bands of the target sensor.
The other class is designed to create these .srf-files from text-based information about weights and wavelengths
in a certain structure which was introduced by Karl Segl for dealing with the EnMAP-end-to-end-simulator (EeteS).

The general concept of a spectral response function is that each band of the target sensor carries information not
only about its central wavelength but also about adjacent wavelengths. For example, EnMAP band 17 @ 503 nm is made up
from wavelengths 492 nm with weight 0.0001, 493 nm with weight 0.0003, 494 nm with weight 0.0014, ... 502 nm with
weight 0.922, 503 nm with weight 1.0, 504 nm with weight 0.922, ... 514 nm with weight 0.0001. Each band of the target
sensor has its own text file which needs to have two columns: wavelengths and weights. Additionally, the central
wavelengths of the target sensors need to be known, as they cannot be extracted from the weights right away. It can
be single column (wavelengths) or two columns (wavelengths & FWHM).
