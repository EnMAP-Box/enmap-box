--------------------------------------------------

This package implements an algorithm in PYTHON to solve regression problems by active learning (pool-based version). It is also applicable to solve classification problems. The package also supports alternative active learning methods: random sampling, greedy sampling based on distances between feature vectors, greedy sampling based on feature vectors and predicted targets (regression only), query-by-committee for regression, and improved representativeness-diversity maximization.

The algorithm is based on the following paper:
