Glossary
========

This glossary gives an overview of how specific terms are used inside the EnMAP-Box.

All the terms that relate to GIS in general should be consistent with the terms given by the `QGIS user manual`_ and GUI.
Because the EnMAP-Box integrates into the QGIS GUI, we try to not (as far as possible) contradict or redefine terminology.

All terms that relate to machine learning should be consistent with the definitions given by `Scikit-Learn`_ and the
`Scikit-Learn glossary`_, because we wildly crosslink into the Scikit-Learn docs!

    spectral band
        A :term:`band` inside a :term:`spectral raster layer`.
        A spectral band represents a measurement for a region of the electromagnetic spectrum around a specific :term:`center wavelength`.
        The region is typically described by a :term:`spectral response function`.

    spectral library
        A :term:`vector layer` with at least one text, JSON or binary field that is designated to a `Spectral Profiles`
        editor. Such :term:`Spectral Profile` fields can contain profile data.
        Additional metadata can be stored like in any other vector layer, e.g. in text and numeric fields.

        Using a vector layer with multiple :term:`Spectral Profile` fields, it possible to link different profiles to
        the same :term:`geographic feature`, e.g. a white reference profile to a field spectrometer profile relating to
        the same spatial position.

        A single profile is represented by a dictionary of the following values:

        * `y`: list of y values, required (e.g. surface reflectance)
        * `x`: list of x values, optional (e.g. :term:`wavelength`)
        * `xUnit`: x value units, optional (e.g. nanometers)
        * `yUnit`: y value units, optional (e.g. ???)
        * `bbl`: optional list of :term:`bad band multiplier` values

        Depending on the selected data type of the spectral profile field, the dictionary is
        stored as plain JSON text or binarized JSON object.

        See `enmapbox.qgispluginsupport.qps.speclib.core.SpectralLibraryUtils` for details.

        where the individual bands (i.e. :term:`spectral bands<spectral band>`) represent measurements across the electromagnetic spectrum.
        The measurement vector of a single pixel is called a :term:`spectral profile`)

        .. image:: img/spectral_profile.png

    spectral response function
        The spectral response describes the sensitivity of a sensor to optical radiation of different wavelengths.
        In hyperspectral remote sensing,
        the spectral response function is often described by a single :term:`full-width-at-half-maximum` value.

    spectral response function library
        A :term:`spectral library`,
        where each profile represents the :term:`spectral response function` of a :term:`spectral band`.

    stratum
    strata
        A :term:`category` of a `classifcation layer` that is used as a :term:`stratification layer`.
        Conceptually, a stratum can be seen as a binary mask with all pixels inside the stratum evaluating to True and all other pixels evaluating to False.

    table
        A :term:`vector layer` with (potentially) missing geometry.

        *Note that in case of missing geometry, the vector layer icon looks like a table and layer styling is disabled.*

    vector feature
        Synonym for :term:`geographic feature`.

    vector layer

Raster Metadata
===============

*Introduction*
    Raster metadata management is mainly based on the **GDAL PAM (Persistent Auxiliary Metadata)** model.
    Depending on the type of metadata, managing specific metadata item in the GUI or programmatically can differ.
    Details are explained in the specific term descriptions below.

    In the GUI, most of the metadata items can be inspected in the :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog,
    under :guilabel:`GDAL Metadata`.

    .. image:: img/raster_layer_gdal_metadata.png
        :width: 100%

    Alternatively, metadata can be managed inside a standard text editor, by opening the GDAL PAM `*.aux.xml` sidecar file.
    If the PAM file not already exists, you can create it manually, but usually, it is also created,
    when a raster file is opened inside QGIS. Here is an excerpt of the ``enmap_berlin.bsq.aux.xml`` PAM file::

        <PAMDataset>

    For managing metadata programmatically, you can mostly use the GDAL API classes ``gdal.Datset`` and ``gdal.Band``,
    or the EnMAP-Box API classes ``enmapboxprocessing.rasterreader.RasterReader``
    and ``enmapboxprocessing.rasterreader.RasterWriter``.

    .. warning::
        If you want to edit metadata in an editor or programmatically,
        be sure to first close the associated raster layer inside QGIS.
        Otherwise, QGIS will overwrite your changes again.


    To examplify the API usage, we assume the following namespace setup throughout the rest of this section::

        from osgeo import gdal
        from enmapboxprocessing.rasterreader import RasterReader
        from enmapboxprocessing.rasterwriter import RasterWriter
        from enmapbox.exampledata import enmap

        # use enmap_berlin.bsq raster layer as example dataset
        dataset: gdal.Dataset = gdal.Open(enmap)
        raster = RasterReader(enmap)

        # assume we have a newly created gdal.Dataset object in update mode
        newDataset: gdal.Dataset
        newRaster = RasterWriter(newDataset)

        # for band-wise interactions, we just use the first band
        bandNo = 1

.. glossary::

    bad band
    bad band list
    bad band multiplier
    bbl
        The bad band multiplier value is indicating whether a :term:`band` is usable (1) or not (0).

        This information is derived from *PAM/Band/Default/bbl*.
        If that is undefined, it is derived by indexing the ENVI bad bands list from *PAM/Dataset/ENVI/bbl*.
        If that is also undefined, it is assumed, that the band is usable (i.e. value=1)::

            # get
            >>>dataset.GetRasterBand(bandNo).GetMetadataItem('bbl')  # isn't sufficient in this case
            >>>dataset.GetMetadataItem('bbl', 'ENVI')  # also not sufficient
            >>>raster.badBandMultiplier(bandNo)  # this will correctly resolve the bad band multiplier
            None
            None
            1

            # set
            >>>newDataset.GetRasterBand(bandNo).SetMetadataItem('bbl', '1')  # set for single band
            >>>newDataset.SetMetadataItem('bbl', '{1, ...., 1}', 'ENVI')  # set for all bands at once
            >>>newRaster.setBadBandMultiplier(1, bandNo)  # set for single band

    band description
    band name
        The name of a :term:`band`.

        Usage example::

            # get
            >>>dataset.GetRasterBand(bandNo).GetDescription()
            >>>raster.bandName(bandNo)
            band 8 (0.460000 Micrometers)
            band 8 (0.460000 Micrometers)

            # set
            >>>newDataset.GetRasterBand(bandNo).SetDescription('my band name')
            >>>newRaster.setBandName('my band name', bandNo)

    center wavelength
        A synonym for :term:`wavelength`.

    fwhm
    full-width-at-half-maximum
        The full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) value of a :term:`spectral band`
        is approximating the :term:`spectral response function` as a normal distribution with a sigma = FWHM / 2.355.
        Units should be the same as those used for :term:`wavelength` and set in the :term:`wavelength units` item.

        This information is derived from *PAM/Band/Default/fwhm*.
        If that is undefined, it is derived by indexing the ENVI fwhm list from *PAM/Dataset/ENVI/fwhm*::

            # get
            >>>dataset.GetRasterBand(bandNo).GetMetadataItem('fwhm')  # isn't sufficient in this case
            >>>text = dataset.GetMetadataItem('fwhm', 'ENVI')  # this gives just a string with values for all bands
            >>>text
            >>>float(text.strip('{}').split(',')[bandNo - 1])  # extra processing required to unpack the band FWHM
            >>>raster.badBandMultiplier(bandNo)  # in Nanometers (the default)

    wavelength
        The center wavelength value of a :term:`band`.

Machine Learning
================

EnMAP-Box provides nearly all of it's machine learning related functionality by using `Scikit-Learn`_ in the background.
So we decided to also adopt related terminology and concepts as far as possible,
while still retaining the connection to GIS and remote sensing in the broader context of being a QGIS plugin.
Most of the following definitions are directly taken from the `Scikit-Learn glossary`_ as is, and only expanded if necessary.

.. glossary::

    classification
        The process of identifying which :term:`category` an object belongs to.

    classifier
        A supervised :term:`estimator` with a finite set of discrete possible :term:`output` values.

    clusterer
        An unsupervised :term:`estimator` with a finite set of discrete :term:`output` values.

    clustering
        The process of automatic grouping of similar objects into sets.

    cross-validation
        The training :term:`dataset` is split into k smaller sets and the following procedure is followed for each of the k "folds":

        * a model is trained using k-1 of the folds as training dataset

        * the resulting model is used to predict the :term:`targets` of the remaining part of the dataset

        The performance can now be calculated from the predictions for the whole training dataset.

        .. image:: img/dataset_cross-val.png

        This approach can be computationally expensive,
        but does not waste too much data (as is the case when fixing an arbitrary :term:`validation set`),
        which is a major advantage in problems where the number of :term:`samples<sample>` is very small.


    dataset
        A dataset is a complete representation of a learning problem, combining :term:`feature` data :term:`X` and :term:`target` data :term:`y`.
        Datasets are often split into sub-datasets.
        One common splitting technique is the train-test split,
        where a part of the dataset is held out as a so-called :term:`training dataset` used for fitting the :term:`estimator` and
        another part is held out as a :term:`test dataset` used for a final evaluation.

        When evaluating different settings (i.e. hyperparameters) for an :term:`estimator`,
        yet another part of the dataset can be held out as a so-called :term:`validation dataset`.
        Training proceeds on the training dataset,
        best parameters are found by evaluating against the validation dataset,
        and final evaluation can be done on the test dataset.
        Holding out a validation datase can be avoided by using :term:`cross-validation` for hyperparameter tuning.

        .. image:: img/dataset_tuning.png

    estimator
        An object which manages the estimation of a model. The model is estimated as a deterministic function.

    evaluation metric
        Evaluation metrics give a measure of how well a model (e.g. a :term:`classifier` or :term:`regressor`)  performs.

        See also https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation

    feature
    feature vector
        In QGIS and other GIS, the term feature is well defined as a logical element defined by a point,
        polyline or polygon inside a :term:`vector layer`.
        In the context of the EnMAP-Box, we refere to it as :term:`geographic feature`.

        In machine learning, a feature is a component in a so-called feature vector,
        which is a list of numeric quantities representing a :term:`sample` in a :term:`dataset`.
        A set of samples with feature data :term:`X` and associated target data :term:`y` or Y form a dataset.

        Elsewhere features are known as attributes, predictors, regressors, or independent variables.
        Estimators assume that features are numeric, finite and not missing.
        :term:`n_features` indicates the number of features in a dataset.

    n_features
        The number of :term:`features` in a :term:`dataset`.

    n_outputs
        The number of :term:`outputs<output>` in a :term:`dataset`.

    n_samples
        The number of :term:`samples<sample>` in a :term:`dataset`.

    n_targets
        Synonym for :term:`n_outputs`.

    output
        Individual scalar/categorical variables per :term:`sample` in the :term:`target`.

        Also called responses, tasks or targets.

    regression
        The process of predicting a continuous-valued attribute associated with an object.

    regressor
        A supervised :term:`estimator` with continuous :term:`output` values.

    sample
        We usually use this term as a noun to indicate a single :term:`feature vector`.

        Elsewhere a sample is called an instance, data point, or observation.
        :term:`n_samples` indicates the number of samples in a dataset,
        being the number of rows in a data array :term:`X`.

    target
        The dependent variable in supervised learning, passed as :term:`y` to an :term:`estimator`'s fit method.

        Also known as dependent variable, outcome variable, response variable, ground truth or label.

    test dataset
        The :term:`dataset` used for final evaluation.

    training dataset
        The :term:`dataset` used for training.

    transformer
        An :term:`estimator` that transforms the input, usually only feature data :term:`X`,
        into some transformed space (conventionally notated as Xt).

    validation dataset
        The :term:`dataset` used for finding best parameters (i.e. hyperparameter tuning).

    X
        Denotes data that is observed at training and prediction time, used as independent variables in learning.
        The notation is uppercase to denote that it is ordinarily a matrix.

    y
    Y
        Denotes data that may be observed at training time as the dependent variable in learning,
        but which is unavailable at prediction time, and is usually the target of prediction.
        The notation may be uppercase to denote that it is a matrix, representing multi-output targets, for instance;
        but usually we use y and sometimes do so even when multiple :term:`outputs<output>` are assumed.
